You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.  Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:  0 &lt;= j &lt;= nums[i] and i + j &lt; n .
